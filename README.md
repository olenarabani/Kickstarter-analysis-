 ## Louise's Kickstarting
 ### Louise’s wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset, I’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.
## For start analyze I use data Kickstarting in Excel. I was sort, organize and prepared data for work. I was needed to see how Outcomes Based on Launch Date and Outcomes Based on Goals. For these firs of all I was make sure all my data is clean and readable.
 ### I start with Outcomes Based on Launch Date. For this I use a pivot table. I filtered it by year and pattern category (theater was filter in pattern category) and filter the column labels to show only "successful," "failed," and "canceled.". After that I crate a pivot chart for visualization.
 ### Next was Outcomes Based on Goals. For this analyze I created new sheet for looking for: Goal, Number Successful, Number Failed, Number Canceled, Total Projects, Percentage Successful, Percentage Failed, Percentage Canceled. For count this I used excel functions. When sheet was ready, I create line chart for visualization.
 ### This project was new for me and for finished it I was spend a lot of time for make sure I use right functions; they correct work and show correct result. Writing report is more confusing part, will be great have a sample.
 ## I suggest Louise start new campaign in Spring. Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date show that Theater more successful May and June, so better start in March-April. And more canceled in Winter, so this season worst for starting new projects.
Outcomes Based on Goal chart show us that Percentage Successful to Percentage Failed looks like half-half. For give deeper result Outcomes Based on Goal I need to more data like ticket price, what time theater start and end, what is a date of week, where it is located.
